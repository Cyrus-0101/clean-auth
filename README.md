# clean-auth

This is a clean architectural approach to creating a sign in and sign up flow API. Migrating an old project to bun and update packages.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
